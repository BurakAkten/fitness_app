# fitness_app

This is a kind of flutter application that shows exercise types that you added. Also you can edit selected exercise fields. 

I used MVVM structure for this application because when I separate business logic with ui, every thing is more clean and safe.

For ViewModel part I used Provider.


## Packages

In this application, I used :

    provider: To manage state of application.
    path_provider: To save exercises in local.
    sqflite: To save exercises in local as Sql table.
    flutter_screenutil: To arrange screen scability.
    fluttertoast: To show toast messages after add and delete exercise.
    flutter_project_base: To manage state and view in base classes. This is my public repo that I imlemented to use in my projects
